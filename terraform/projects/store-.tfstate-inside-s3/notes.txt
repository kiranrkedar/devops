Steps:

1. Create the s3 bucket
    a. terraform init
    b. terraform plan
    c. terraform apply

2. Enable the backend
    a. Uncomment the "terraform { backend "s3" ... }" block
    b. terraform init
    c. you will be prompted: Do you want to migrate existing state to the new backend? -> Type "yes"

Conclusion: You can now keep everything in one file, and terraform will use the S3 bucket for future .tfstate storage

It will showcase how we can print first (or any index) user from the list

- 1. apply 
    terraform plan

- 2. enter user list
    var.users
         Enter a value: ["Krunal", "Pratik","Gaurav"] 

- 3. see the first user name
    Changes to Outputs:
        + printUsers = "First User is Krunal"

*** you can try for any user/index by changing the index in variable.tf file
        value = "First User is ${var.users[0]}" ...  here instead of 0 you can any number (number should be <= to your user list length)

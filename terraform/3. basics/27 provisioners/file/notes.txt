This will demonstrate how we can send file (from current machine like local/ec2/terraform machine) inside ec2 instance (remote machine) using provisioner

Steps:
1. touch notes.txt
2. terraform init
3. terraform plan
4. terraform apply
5. download/import the "terraform-key.pem"
6. get the ssh access of newly created ec2 instance ( ssh -i terraform-key.pem ubuntu@<ec2-public-ip> )
7. sudo -i
8. cd /tmp
9. ls - you can see the notes.txt file inside the newly created ec2
